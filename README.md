# SR-Predictor-Python
A project where a model was built to predict which customers would submit a service request during the organizations peak season.

Data was imported to a Jupyter notebook and an initial model was stood up. From there, hyperparameters were tuned and feature trimming was conducted.
The intention of this script is to qualify my experience with python and statistical methodologies.

There are cell blocks where file and column names have been anonymized per guidance from legal. Additionally, the data files are not available for upload to GitHub and as such the cell blocks are not run, the original code is just on display.
